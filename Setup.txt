Hello Person!

Reeky template bot
Made by : Shawn
Beta testers: Suzcat , prg , kegan , velocity, calories
Version : 1.0.1

//**Setting up your bot**//

i see you have downloaded my basic bot file.

First open your terminal (ctrl + `)
then type npm i discord.js in it to download discord.js
then u would need to download fs (we would be needing it to run the command and event handler)

Then you will need to open the cofig folder and edit client.json
in there you would need to add your token (dont show this to anyone) and the bot prefix

remeber, your main file is index.js
you can change your main file from package.json 
note : you would also need to rename index.js to the name of the file you have changed the main file to

you can also add more things like author, version of the bot, description about it, and the name of it

and you are basically downloaded
just run the bot tru terminal (ctrl + `)

To run the bot :
1) open terminal
2) type node . or node index.js

//**Making a custom command**//

to make a custom command the first thing u would need to do is export the module so basically type 

-----------------------------------
module.exports = {}
-----------------------------------

now inside the {} you would whana give the name of the command, cooldown, description, aliases, permisssions and the execute funtion with the parameters client, message, args ,Discord

-----------------------------------
module.exports = {
    name: "test",
    cooldown: 5,
     aliases: ["t"],
     permisssions: ["ADMINISTRATOR"],
    description: "A test command",
    execute(client, message, args ,Discord){

    }
-----------------------------------

the thing is done now all u would need to do is add the code u wnt to run in the execute funtion

-----------------------------------
module.exports = {
    name: "test",
    cooldown: 5,
    aliases: ["t"],
    permisssions: ["ADMINISTRATOR"],
    description: "A test command",
    execute(client, message, args ,Discord){
        message.channel.send('Test command works');
    }
-----------------------------------


//**Custom status**//
To change the status of the bot you would need to edit status.json in the config folder
first u gota add the content of the status, for example

"name": ["youtube"]

and then u gota change the type of the status
a few valid types are 
"WATCHING"
"PLAYING"
"COMPETING"
"STREAMING"

    "type": ["WATCHING"]

after you have done this save and restart the bot and it should change the status every 30 seconds

//**Error detection**//

This feature sends an message in the channel if tere is something wrong with the custom commands that you made.
